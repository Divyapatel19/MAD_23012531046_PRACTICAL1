Practical-1: 

AIM: Develop a Kotlin program for demonstrating various programming concepts.

Introduction
This practical is designed to provide hands-on experience with Kotlin programming. It demonstrates a wide range of programming concepts such as data types, type conversion, control flow, functions, recursion, arrays, collections, classes, constructors, and operator overloading. Each program showcases a fundamental concept of Kotlin and how it can be applied in problem-solving.

1. Variables & Data Types – Demonstrates declaring and displaying variables of different types.
Store and print values of Int, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, and String.

2.Type Conversion – Converts between Int, Double, and String.
Convert Int to Double, String to Int, and String to Double using built-in functions.

3.Student Info – Takes user input and displays student details.
Takes user input and displays student details.

4.Odd/Even Check – Uses control flow to determine parity.
Checks if a number is odd or even.

5.Month Name – Uses 'when' expression to print month names.
Prints month name using when expression.

6. User Defined Function – Performs arithmetic operations.
Uses user-defined function for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

7.Recursion – Calculates factorial recursively.
Finds factorial of a number using recursion.

8. Arrays – Demonstrates array operations and sorting.
Shows how to use arrays, loops, and sorting.

9. ArrayList Max – Finds maximum value in ArrayList.
This program creates an ArrayList of integers and uses the maxOrNull() function to find the largest element. It highlights the use of collection functions in Kotlin.

10.Class & Constructor – Implements Car class with functions.
Kotlin supports object-oriented programming. This program defines a 'Car' class with properties such as type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. It includes member functions to display car information, get the original price, and calculate the current price after usage.

11.Operator Overloading – Implements matrix operations with custom 'toString()'.
Kotlin allows operator overloading. This program defines a 'Matrix' class and overloads the operators +, -, and * to perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The toString() function is also overridden to print the matrix in a readable format.

Conclusion
This practical covered fundamental to advanced Kotlin concepts including:
- Basic data types, type conversion, and I/O
- Control flow (if-else, when)
- Functions (normal & recursive)
- Arrays and collections
- Object-oriented concepts (classes, constructors, methods)
- Operator overloading and matrix operations
